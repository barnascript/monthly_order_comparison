Today in Tableau, a solution I came up with was to utilise a heat grid that makes it easy for anyone to scan down a column and across a row and see the variance between two results.

I compared the performance of different portfolios of investments, comparing the volume of sales in any of the month of the year to any other month. 

l used the sales store example data for this, you can download that and the final workbook below:

### Note: Comparing monthly results is actually pretty poor practice as months have varying numbers of days so shouldn’t be compared like for like, in retail a month with more weekends will typically have greater sales too. In reality you’d create an average per day to counteract the differing number of days, or use a 4 week period but for this project I’ll keep it simple!
